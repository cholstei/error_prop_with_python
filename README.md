# error_prop_with_python
Notes how to use python to calculate errors and more in a basic physics lab course

This are a few jupyter notebooks to learn how to use
  - the uncertainties package for error propagation;
  - Curve fitting for linear regression with error estimates;
  - the pandas package instead of a spreadsheet.

In a basic physics lab for non-physicists.
